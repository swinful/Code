// Problem 1
// 
// Appendix 4 of your book describes some functions that you can use in C++ if you 
// include the appropriate files. On page 918 there are some functions that work 
// on characters. Write a program that reads a word that begins and ends with a * 
// character, and converts it so that all of the letters become upper case. Here 
// is an example (user input has been underlined):
// 
// Please enter a word beginning and ending with a *: *HeLlo*
// *HELLO*

// Problem 2
// Write a program similar to problem 1, except that it converts all lower case 
// letters to upper case, and vice versa
// Please enter a word beginning and ending with a *: *HeLlo*
// *hElLO*

// Problem 3
// Write a program that asks the user for two odd integers. Your program should
// count up (by 2's) from the smaller number to the larger number, and print as 
// it counts. Here's a sample run.
// Please enter an odd integer: 25
// Please enter an odd integer: 12
// 12 is not odd, please try again: 11
// 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25

// Because we've just learned about functions, I want you to get some practice with 
// writing functions, so you must write and use the following functions:

// int get_odd_int ( );
// get_odd_int asks the user to input an odd integer. If the user does, that integer 
// is returned, otherwise the user is repeatedly asked again until they do give an odd
// integer, which is then returned

// void print_by_twos(int smaller, int bigger);
// This function prints out the odd numbers between smaller and bigger inclusive with
// spaces in between.  For example, if smaller is 1 and bigger is 7 this will print
// 1 3 5 7

// It is assumed that smaller and bigger are both odd. It is also assumed that smaller
// is less than bigger. If either of these assumptions are broken, the function may 
// behave unpredictably.
