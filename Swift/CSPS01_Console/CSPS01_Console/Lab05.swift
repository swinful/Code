// Problem 1
// Write a program that asks the user for a character and prints five copies 
// of that character on the screen. For example, if the user entered +, the 
// program would print:
// 
// +++++
//
// You must use a for loop to do this problem


// Problem 2
// Write a program that asks the user for a character and prints 3 rows, with 5 
// copies of that character on each row. For example, if the user entered *, the 
// program would print:
// 
// *****
// *****
// *****
// 
//
// Write a program that asks the user for a character, a number of rows, and a number 
// of columns, and prints a picture with that many rows and columns and that character. 
// Here's a sample run (user input has been underlined, your output should match mine 
// given the same input):
// 
// Please enter the number of columns: 4
// Please enter the number of rows: 6
// Please enter the character to print: #
// 
// Here's your picture:
// 
// ####
// ####
// ####
// ####
// ####
// ####

// Problem 4
// Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 on the screen. You must use a for 
// loop to do this problem. (Note, there is no user input in this problem)
// 12345

// Problem 5
// Write a program that displays 3 copies of the numbers from 1 to 5 so it looks like the 
// following on the screen (Note, there is no user input in this problem:)
//
// 12345
// 12345
// 12345

// Problem 6
// Write a program that displays a similar design to problem 3, but this time the number 
// of lines is read from the user. For example, if the user wants the number of lines to 
// be 6, the program will display the following design:
// 
// 12345
// 12345
// 12345
// 12345
// 12345
// 12345
// 

// Problem 7
// Write a program that displays on the screen a design similar to problem 4, but this time 
// the number of columns is also read from the user. For example, if the user wants the 
// number of lines to be 6 and the number of columns to be 3, the program will display the following design:
// 123
// 123
// 123
// 123
// 123
// 123
