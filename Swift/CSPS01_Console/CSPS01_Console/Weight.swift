  // Note: The const keyboard appended to this function in C++ was used

  // by const was not followed. In Swift, the keyword mutating or nonmutating
  // is not applicable here. Instead they are applicable to value types like
  // struct or enums. A class in swift is not a value type. Hence, why mutating
  // or nonmutating are not applicable. A class method in Swift can always change
  // its properties.
