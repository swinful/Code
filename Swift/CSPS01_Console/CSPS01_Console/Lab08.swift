// Problem 1:
// 
// Write a program that asks the user for two characters. It should print the characters, 
// then call a "swap" function (as described in class), and then print the (swapped) 
// characters again (so the order is reversed).
// 
// Your swap function must have the following prototype:
// 
// void swap (char &c1, char &c2);
